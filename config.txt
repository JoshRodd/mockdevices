This is an example of how to use noncontiguous netmasks with a large, private
network. The example here uses IBM's class A, 9.0.0.0/8. You can adapt it to
any network including the 10.0.0.0/8 network.

This example uses ASAs, so the devices are called "ibmasa-site#-9-1-2-3".

The asamock.py program is written with the assumption that a network looks
like below. It deduces which class A network is in use based upon the
incoming IP address, and assumes the ASA management address lives on a /30.
You can execute it like this:

	./asamock.py 9.0.0.1

If you are running inside SSH, it checks SSH's environment variables to
see on what interface you connected. If you configure your machine with
an alias of 9.0.0.1, SSH to that machine at 9.0.0.1, and execute the
asamock.py program, it will create a valid configuration for an ASA network
device in that network.

By running `make install' and setting a login shell to
/usr/local/bin/asabin, the above can look exactly like a real ASA. You may need
to execute ./install-shells.sh /usr/local/bin/asabin as well.

Network base:
	9.0.0.0/8

Number of devices:
	512

First management address:
	9.0.0.1 (ibmasa-site1-9-0-0-1)

Last management address:
	9.0.7.253 (ibmasa-site512-9-0-7-253)

Configure with:
	sudo ./ifconfig-loopbacks -i lo0 --ncsubnet=9.0.0.1/21 --hostprefix=ibmasa

Check with:
	ifconfig -a | fgrep -e "9.0.0.1 " -e 9.0.7.253

Expected output:
	inet 9.0.0.1 netmask 0xffffffff
	inet 9.0.7.253 netmask 0xffffffff

Interfaces on each device, for 9.0.0.1:
	9.0.0.0/30: "outside" (MPLS)
		9.0.0.1: ASA management address
		9.0.0.1: WAN link
		9.0.0.2: WAN peer
	9.128.0.0/25: "MPI"
		9.128.0.0.1: MPI ASA management address
	9.128.0.128/25: "MPE"
		9.128.0.0.129: MPE ASA management address
	10.100.0.0/24: "users"
		10.100.0.1: 
	default: 9.0.0.2

Networks:
	9.128.0.0/255.255.0.128: MPIs, subnetted into 512 /25s
	9.128.0.128/255.255.0.128: MPEs, subnetted into 512 /25s
	10.100.0.0/15: Users, subnetted into 512 /24s

Mapping:
	Site #1: 9.0.0.0 -> 9.128.0.0 -> 9.128.0.128 -> 10.100.0.0
	Site #2: 9.0.0.4 -> 9.128.1.0 -> 9.128.1.128 -> 10.100.1.0
	Site #64: 9.0.0.252 -> 9.128.63.0 -> 9.128.63.128 -> 10.100.63.0
	Site #256: 9.0.4.0 -> 9.128.64.0 -> 9.128.64.128 -> 10.100.255.0
	Site #257: 9.0.4.4 -> 9.129.0.0 -> 9.129.0.128 -> 10.101.0.0
	Site #512: 9.0.7.252 -> 9.129.255.0 -> 9.129.255.128 -> 10.101.255.0
